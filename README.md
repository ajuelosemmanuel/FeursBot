# Feurs Bot
Little Discord bot to learn how it works !

# Requirements

Packages :
- discord
- asyncio
- random
- os
- speech_recognition
- pydub
- moviepy
- googletrans
- pytube
- discord.ext.tasks
- pathlib
- ffmpeg

Maybe more stuff, did not check well D:

Need to have discord.py[voice] and opus - Will probably need to have one of those : https://github.com/Gorialis/discord.py/tree/voice-recv-mk3 or https://github.com/imayhaveborkedit/discord.py

# What does he do ?

For commands : check .help / will update here when I'm a bit less busy.

Else : says "feur" when someone says "quoi", and maybe a little bit more :)

# I used code from those people / videos / websites ( might have forgotten some, tell me if I did so !)
