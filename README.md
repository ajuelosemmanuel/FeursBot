# Feurs Bot
Little Discord bot to learn how it works !

# Want to add Feurs ?

https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=805559389963681822&permissions=8&scope=bot

Why admin permissions ? Because I'm lazy and that I don't know what I'll do with the bot.
If you add the bot to one of your servers, please tell me ! I'd love to know why you added it and have feedback !

# Requirements

Packages :
- discord
- asyncio
- random
- os
- speech_recognition
- pydub
- moviepy
- googletrans==3.1.0a0
- pytube
- pathlib
- ffmpeg

Maybe more stuff, did not check well D:

Need to have opus and FFMPEG - This version of discord.py[voice] : https://github.com/Gorialis/discord.py/tree/voice-recv-mk3 that you can instal directly with
```
pip install -U "discord.py[voice] @ git+https://github.com/Gorialis/discord.py@voice-recv-mk3"
```

# What does he do ?

For commands : check .help / will update here when I'm a bit less busy.

Else : says "feur" when someone says "quoi", and maybe a little bit more :)

# I used code from those people / videos / websites ( might have forgotten some, tell me if I did so !)

# To Do

- Improve the speech recognition (not able to do that atm, I'll pray for discord.py to implement that one day) // Managed to make it work on javascript using healzer's DiscordEarsBot (that you can find here : https://github.com/healzer/DiscordEarsBot). However, it is not possible to do it efficiently on python at the moment (11/03/2021).

# Want more features ?

Feel free to contact me either through discord or mail, I'll see what I can do for you ! I don't have plans for this bot so I guess it will do random stuff for now :)
